# Parking Lot Manager — Baseline (Step 1)

This is the untouched baseline from the provided prototype. We'll use it to capture the **original** behavior and diagrams before refactoring.

## Layout
- `src/` — the original Python files exactly as provided (`ParkingManager.py`, `Vehicle.py`, `ElectricVehicle.py`)
- `docs/` — project documentation will go here in later steps

## Run (baseline)
```bash
cd src
python ParkingManager.py
```
> Note: Tkinter comes with the standard Python installer on most platforms. If you see an error about `_tkinter`, install the Tk libraries for your OS.

## Next Steps
1. Record **before** screenshots/video (Step 2).
2. Add tooling config and initial tests (Step 3–5).
3. Draw **original** UML (Step 6).
